            I started my career in 2015 as a Graphic Designer, shaping visual
            identities and creating both digital and print assets across a range
            of mediums. I also spent a year studying graphic design in Czechia
            and later worked for nearly five years at a major e-commerce
            company, where I was responsible for UI banners, print materials,
            and motion graphics.

            In 2022, I transitioned into Front-End Development to merge my
            design roots with a growing passion for building clean, engaging
            user interfaces. Now based in Ankara, I focus on creating
            responsive, accessible, and visually refined web applications.

            With a strong foundation in visual design and a solid grasp of
            modern front-end tools like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, I aim
            to bridge the gap between aesthetics and functionalityâ€”crafting user
            experiences that are not only beautiful but also intuitive,
            performant, and scalable.
