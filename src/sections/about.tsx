            I began my career in 2015 as a Graphic Designer, where I spent
            several years shaping visual identities and crafting digital and
            printable assets across diverse mediums.
            <br />
            <br />
            <span className="font-semibold">Front-End Development</span> to In
            2022, I transitioned into Front-End Development merge my design
            background with my growing passion for building intuitive and
            engaging user interfaces. Currently based in Ankara, I focus on
            developing responsive, accessible, and visually refined web
            applications.
            <br />
            <br />
            With a strong foundation in visual design and a deep understanding
            of modern front-end technologies, I aim to deliver clean,
            maintainable code and seamless user experiences. My toolkit includes
            technologies like React, Next.js, and Tailwind CSS, and I
            consistently stay aligned with evolving best practices in UI/UX,
            performance optimization, and scalable design systems.
            <br />
            <br />
            My goal is to bridge the gap between aesthetics and
            functionalityâ€”crafting digital experiences that are not only
            visually compelling but also intuitive, efficient, and future-ready.
